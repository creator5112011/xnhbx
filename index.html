        <h5> About </h5>
        <p>
            If you love listening to music, you’re in good company. Charles Darwin once remarked, “If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week.” Albert Einstein declared, “If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.” Jimi Hendrix called music his “religion.”

        <p>This song is pretty cool and head banging. I don't understand what they're saying, exactly, but I really like the music. As CSM mentioned, there's no inappropriate content to speak of, so this is perfect for all ages (though I doubt youngsters will understand the lyrics).</p>
